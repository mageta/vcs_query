This scripts parses all vcards in the directory given with -d
and prints them in a format that is usable as $query-command in mutt.

The first non-option argument is interpreted as a pattern to filter the
resulting lines.

As parsing can take some time, the results are cached in ~/.cache/vcs_query.
